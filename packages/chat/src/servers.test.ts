/**
 * The roster, over values.

 * What a person is told this conversation can reach is a sentence worth
 * asserting without starting a subprocess — and the cases that matter most here
 * are ones a running agent will not produce on demand: an agent that names a
 * server olai never handed over, one that reports the `kolu` this host's probe
 * already refused, a status word no released version has sent. Each is three
 * lines as a value and a fixture nobody would maintain as a scenario.
 *
 * The e2e suite drives the whole thing through a real panel
 * (`packages/tests/features/the_conversations_servers.feature`) and stays the
 * regression net for the wiring.
