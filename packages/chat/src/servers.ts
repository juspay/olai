/**
 * WHICH MCP servers a conversation has, and how each one stands.
 *
 * `mcp-roster-visible`: the panel answers "what tool servers does this
 * conversation have?" instead of leaving the MODEL to answer it. The incident
 * is the model getting it wrong — an opencode asked that question listed olai
 * and deepwiki, omitted kolu, and then called `kolu_lifecycle_create`
 * perfectly. Nothing in a conversation's context is a record of what it was
 * handed; the client that handed it over is the only thing that knows.
 *
 * THE ROSTER IS BUILT IN LAYERS, and each layer is only as certain as whoever
 * spoke for it. That is the whole design, and the reason these are two
 * functions rather than one:
 *
 *   - **what olai handed over** ({@link rosterOf}) is fully known, because this
 *     process composed the list and put it on the wire. It is read off the very
 *     array given to `session/new`, so a roster row cannot describe a server
 *     the session was not actually given — the two cannot drift, because
 *     there is only one of them.
 *   - **what the agent then made of it** ({@link movedBy}) is knowable only
 *     where the agent says so. ACP itself never does: `session/new` answers
 *     with a session id and not one word per server, which is why #140 could
 *     only ever report the failures olai found ITSELF. One agent does say —
 *     the Claude Code adapter forwards its CLI's `system`/`init`, and that
 *     message carries a status per server (`olai-plugin-claude`'s `leg.ts`) — and an
 *     agent that says nothing leaves every row at `handed`, which is an honest
 *     answer rather than a degraded one.
 *   - **what the AGENT brought of its own** is in neither, and is not in this
 *     module at all. See {@link movedBy} for why a row for one could not be
 *     kept honest, and `../../web/src/client/chat/Roster.tsx` for the sentence
 *     the panel says instead.
 *
 * PURE, and separated from {@link ./agent.ts} for the reason every leg rule is:
 * "what a person is told this conversation can reach" is a sentence worth
 * asserting without starting a subprocess, and the interesting cases here — an
 * agent that names a server we never handed, a status word nobody has seen
 * before — are ones a running agent would not produce on demand.

/**

 *
 * Declared here rather than in {@link ./probes.ts} because it is this module's
 * INPUT, and because all four standings are minted below: a probe answers what
 * it found, and what a roster makes of that — which arm, which sentence, and
 * the rule that nothing an agent says may overwrite it — is one vocabulary in
 * one file. `where` is `null` for the ways of failing that never reached a
 * file.
 *
 * `why` IS THE PROBE'S OWN WHOLE SENTENCE and this file does not touch it. The
 * words belong to whoever found out — kolu's five ways of failing are

/**
 * The roster as OLAI composed it: every server this session was handed, plus
 * the one it was meant to have and did not.
 *
 * Read off `handing` — the literal `mcpServers` array that goes to
 * `session/new` ({@link ./agent.ts}'s `mcpServersOf`) — rather than off the
 * values that array was built from. The panel's list and the session's list are
 * then the same list read twice, and the failure mode this closes is the one
 * that matters most here: a roster that says a conversation has a server it was
 * never given is worse than the silence it replaces, because it is the same
 * wrong answer the model was giving, in a place a person has decided to trust.
 *
 * `where` is where the server IS, in whichever way its transport spells that:
 * the URL for one reached over http, the absolute executable for one spawned on
 * this host. Both come off the entry itself, so an entry shape this does not
 * know says `null` rather than guessing — and a `null` there is drawn as
 * nothing at all rather than as a blank line.
 *
 * ORDER IS THE ORDER THEY WERE HANDED, with the missing ones after them. It is
 * the only order that is a fact rather than a preference, and it puts olai's
 * own server first because olai's own server is handed first; the misses keep
 * the order they were probed in, which is the order the build declares its
 * plugins in.
 *
 * A LIST rather than one miss, and it became one the same day the probe did
 * ({@link ./probes.ts}). Any number of optional servers can fail to be here at
 * once, and the two halves have to agree about arity or a second plugin's
 * finding is silently the first one's: what a session was handed is a list, and
 * what it was not is the same list's other half.
 *
 * @param handing the `mcpServers` this session is being opened with
 * @param missing what a person is owed about the servers it was not given —
 *   empty when there was nothing to miss ({@link ./probes.ts}'s `missingIn`; a

/**
 * ... and the roster as the AGENT's own report leaves it — or `null` when that
 * report moved nothing.
 *
 * `null` for "nothing moved" because this is asked on every message an agent
 * forwards, and the Claude Code adapter forwards one per TURN: a conversation
 * whose servers are all fine would otherwise republish an identical roster to
 * every open tab for the life of the session. It is the same shape
 * {@link ./agent.ts} already reads the live model through, for the same reason.
 *
 * WHAT MOVES, and what deliberately does not:
 *
 *   - **a handed row the agent named** takes the agent's answer. `connected` is
 *     recognised positively and everything else becomes `unattached` carrying
 *     the agent's own word — a status set that grows on somebody else's release
 *     schedule may not be a set this file claims to know.
 *   - **a handed row the agent did NOT name** keeps the standing it had. An
 *     agent naming some of its servers has said nothing about the others, and
 *     reading silence as a downgrade would make a row flicker on every message
 *     that happened to be shorter than the last. It is {@link ./calls.ts}'s
 *     rule over a different subject — a frame REFINES and never retracts, so
 *     an absent field is "nothing has said yet" — and it is written out again
 *     rather than shared, because that registry is a per-call lookup a
 *     permission question consults and this is an ordered list published whole.
 *   - **a `missing` row is never touched**, whatever the agent says. That row
 *     is olai's own probe's finding about a server it did NOT hand over, so an
 *     agent reporting a server of that name is reporting its OWN — a `kolu` out
 *     of somebody's `~/.claude.json`, not the one this host's padi would not
 *     answer for. Letting it overwrite the probe would turn the one failure
 *     #140 exists to show back into a tick.
 *   - **a server the agent names that olai never handed** adds no row, and
 *     this is the layer's boundary rather than an oversight. The agent's own
 *     MCP servers are configured where olai cannot see, are told to us at most
 *     once per turn by an agent free to reconnect one in between, and are
 *     absent entirely from the other leg — so a row for one is a row that
 *     could never be kept honest, on one agent only. The panel says "plus the
 *     agent's own" instead, which is true of every agent and stays true.
