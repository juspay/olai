/**
 * The questions on the wire, and the one rule about them: each ends exactly
 * once.
 *
 * A question the agent asked is a JSON-RPC request that has not been answered
 * yet, which is the same thing as a turn that has not moved. So what has to be
 * held is a promise per question, and what has to be got right is the race:
 * somebody answers in one tab while somebody dismisses in another, while the
 * agent withdraws the question because the turn was cancelled, while the
 * subprocess dies. Every one of those is a call to `settle`, the first one wins
 * and the rest are no-ops — which is what makes the row on screen and the value
 * on the wire unable to disagree.
 *
 * It is its own module because it is a state machine rather than a protocol
 * fact: nothing in here knows what ACP is, and the whole of it is reachable
 * without a subprocess. That is not a matter of taste. `withdrawAll` was
 * written to clear the map and then settle what it had taken out — which
 * settles nothing, because settling is what removes an entry — and every
 * question would have hung on a conversation that had already ended. Inside the
 * client's closure that bug needed an agent, a browser and a cancelled turn to
 * see; here it is four lines of test.
