/**
 * The ACP client: one subprocess, one protocol, no browser.
 *
 * Everything about the Agent Client Protocol stops here — nothing else in olai
 * spells `session/prompt` — and nothing in here knows what a surface member, a
 * transcript entry or a browser is. A caller gets something it can boot,
 * prompt, cancel, list, load and stop, plus a stream of typed events through
 * the one handler it gave at construction ({@link ./events.ts}).
 *
 * What this owns, and why:
 *
 *   - **the subprocess and the conversation it comes up in.** Boot is
 *     adopt-or-create, and it is here rather than in the caller because it is a
 *     sequence whose order is a protocol fact: `initialize` says whether the
 *     agent even keeps sessions, `session/list` is scoped by the directory we
 *     were started in, a `session/load` replays before it answers, and the
 *     model is read off whichever result made the session. WHICH one it comes
 *     up in is {@link adopt}: the conversation this panel was last in, written
 *     down when it entered one ({@link ./memory.ts}), with the
 *     most-recently-updated one as the fallback for when that is gone — and,
 *     on the way back into it, the model it was switched to, put back through
 *     the picker the agent's own boot has just overruled ({@link restore}).
 *   - **the questions the agent asks a person**, both kinds. An
 *     `elicitation/create` is a form; a `session/request_permission` that is not
 *     one of ours is a single-select. What is HERE is that both are the same
 *     question and which methods carry them; the payload shapes are
 *     `@olai/acp`'s (its `asks.ts`) and the promise-per-question state machine
 *     is {@link ./questions.ts}, so neither is one more thing this file's
 *     closure has to get right at the same time as a subprocess.
 *   - **which permission requests are answered without asking.** Bypass mode is
 *     the design (resolved 2026-08-09), so a call to one of the MCP servers WE
 *     handed this session — olai's mediated ops, plus whatever optional server
 *     this host answered a probe with — is allowed immediately, and everything
 *     else is a person's to answer. What is HERE is
 *     that the two paths exist and which one a request took; the rule that
 *     tells them apart is this agent's LEG (`@olai/acp/engine`'s `Leg`), where it is a pure function
 *     with unit tests rather than a branch inside a subprocess's callback.
 *   - **reading the payloads**: which update kind this is, what a content block
 *     says, how a session list sorts. An event carries what was READ, never the
 *     raw protocol value. What any of it means to the CLAUDE CODE adapter in
 *     particular — its `_meta`, its tool naming, the message it forwards, which
 *     config option its picker is — is its LEG's (`@olai/acp/engine`'s `Leg`); what is still
 *     here is what those readings are REMEMBERED as, which is a session's job.
 *
 * The MCP servers a session is given are olai's own internal one — the standard
 * ACP shape, and the only channel the agent has to the ops layer — plus
 * whatever OPTIONAL ones this host turns out to be running, probed per session
 * rather than at boot. This file names none of the second kind and could not:
 * the list is handed in ({@link Options.probes}) and what is on it is the
 * composition root's business, so the whole of what is here is that they are
 * asked once per conversation and what becomes of the answer
 * ({@link ./probes.ts}). The whole list travels as an event like any
 * other (`servers`), with a standing per row ({@link ./servers.ts}), so which
 * servers a conversation HAS is something the panel can say rather than
 * something the model gets asked and answers out of a context that never
 * contained it — and a detection that FAILED is one row of that answer rather
 * than the only news there is.
 *
 * `fs` capabilities are FALSE in both directions on purpose: this is not an
 * editor, and an agent that could write a file whole would be routing around
 * the format. `elicitation.form` is TRUE, and it is
 * what makes any of the above happen at all: without it the Claude Code adapter
 * puts `AskUserQuestion` in `disallowedTools`, so the agent cannot ask a
 * structured question — it has to guess, or write the question into prose and
 * hope.

/**
 * HOW a verb failed — three ways, because a caller has TWO questions and two
 * values could only ever answer one of them.
 *
 *   - `refused` — THE AGENT SAID NO. It answered the request with a JSON-RPC
 *     error: a method it does not have, a session it does not know, a mode it
 *     cannot work from. Whatever was asked for did not happen (that is
 *     JSON-RPC's own bet about its own error responses), so asking again is
 *     honest — and the agent is demonstrably THERE, because it just spoke.
 *   - `unreachable` — NOTHING WAS ASKED OF ANYTHING. This file refused before
 *     the request reached the wire: no process, a spawn that failed, no session
 *     open, a notification the pipe would not take. Also did not happen, also
 *     honest to ask again — and nothing here can say the agent is there.
 *   - `unanswered` — the request went out and NOTHING came back: the deadline
 *     passed, or the connection died with it in flight. Whether the agent acted
 *     on it cannot be known from this end — one that took a message and then
 *     went quiet is indistinguishable from one that never took it — so the
 *     honest thing to do with this is SAY so, and never quietly ask again.
 *
 * THE TWO QUESTIONS, read off the one value, which is why it is one value:
 *
 *   - *can I honestly offer this again?* — anything but `unanswered`. That is
 *     the row's `delivery` ({@link ../../surface/src/chat.ts}), which stays two
 *     valued because it is only ever asked this one;
 *   - *is the agent still there?* — `refused`, and only `refused`. It used to
 *     be unaskable: the two local arms above shared a word with the agent's own
 *     no, so a turn the agent refused was indistinguishable from a turn there
 *     was no agent to refuse it, and the panel said `not running` about a
 *     process that had just spoken to it.
 *
 * Splitting the first two rather than adding a second field is what keeps the
 * illegal combination unspellable: "the agent answered, and it is not there" is
 * not a value.
 *
 * The WIRE decides which of the first and last, not the caller: an error
 * RESPONSE arrives as the SDK's own {@link RequestError}, and every other
 * rejection — a closed connection, an interrupted deadline — is silence wearing
 * an `Error`. That reading is {@link goneOf}, and it lives here rather than in
 * `@olai/acp/engine`'s `Leg` because it is the protocol SDK's vocabulary rather
 * than one adapter's extension. `unreachable` is never read off a rejection: it

     *
     *   - the session's CONFIG OPTION is what was PICKED. It arrives with
     *     `session/new` and again in a `config_option_update` whenever
     *     anything in that set moves;
     *   - the CLI's own `system`/`init` message is what is RUNNING. It is
     *     forwarded because `session/new` asked for it.
     *
     * They part company at a `/model` slash command: the Claude Code adapter
     * wraps a CLI that handles it internally, so the adapter never learns of
     * it and goes on reporting the model the session started on, forever.
     *
     * WHICHEVER MOVED LAST WINS, and each source is debounced against its OWN
     * previous value — which is what stops a picker RE-SENDING a value it
     * already sent from overwriting a `/model` the CLI reported since. It is
     * not that the picker stops being trusted once the CLI has spoken: when
     * the picker genuinely moves it is because the model genuinely moved (a
     * refusal fallback re-picks the row it fell back to), and a panel that had
     * decided to stop listening would sit on a stale name until the next turn.
     *
     * The picker also supplies the LABELS, and that is not a side job:
     * {@link nameFor} is what turns a live API id back into the word the
     * agent uses for it. Without it the header could only ever name a running
     * model as `claude-sonnet-5`, beside a picker calling it "Sonnet".
     *
     * And what reaches the panel is debounced once more, ON THE NAME, in
     * {@link show}. That is what makes two sources AGREEING say nothing at all
     * — the case that used to need the first live id special-cased as a
     * "baseline" on the untrue grounds that it agrees with the config option BY
     * CONSTRUCTION. It does not: the picker said `claude-fable-5[1m]` while the
     * CLI said `claude-fable-5`. They agree once resolved, which is a thing to
     * check rather than assume.
     *
     * ONE TURN LATE, and this is the adapter's floor rather than ours. The
     * `init` for a turn is emitted as that turn STARTS, so the turn that runs
     * `/model` still reports the model it began on; the new one arrives with
     * the NEXT turn's `init`. Nothing else on the wire carries it — captured
     * with `emitRawSDKMessages: true` against 0.66.0, the only trace of the
     * change in that whole turn is a `<synthetic>` assistant message saying so
     * in prose, and there is no read-only config verb to ask again with. A
     * panel that closed the gap would be reading a sentence or inventing one.

     * THE BUG THIS IS (`chat-model-reverts-on-restart`): a person switches the
     * chat with `/model`, olai is redeployed, and the same conversation comes
     * back on the model the container pins. Nothing in the panel had gone wrong
     * — the agent really is running that model, and the header really is naming
     * what it was told. The pin outranks the conversation at the agent's end:
     * the adapter (captured at 0.66.0) resolves a session's model as env, then
     * `settings.json`, then the resumed transcript, and for a RESUMED session
     * it deliberately re-asserts the first two over the third with `setModel`,
     * because "a resumed session lands on the transcript's model regardless of
     * env/settings". A `/model` lives only in that transcript. So it loses,
     * every boot, silently, and the only remedy that did not need code was to
     * go and delete a line from a file inside the container.
     *
     * WHAT IS DONE ABOUT IT: the model is the picker, and the picker is a
     * config option a client may SET. So the panel says, once, after the load,
     * what this conversation was running — and the agent's own re-assert, which
     * ran during the load, is a thing that happened before we said it.
     *
     * SAID ONLY WHEN IT DISAGREES, and disagreement is judged in names rather
     * than in strings ({@link sameAs}): what we remember is as often a live
     * API id (`claude-fable-5`) as a picker value (`fable`), and those are the
     * same model. A conversation that came back on the model it left on is one
     * this says nothing about at all — no round trip, and no request to fail.
     *
     * SAID IN THE PICKER'S OWN WORDS, for the same reason one step further on
     * ({@link pickerValueFor}): a config option takes the values the picker
     * offers, and what we remember is the id the CLI reported. The pinned
     * adapter would resolve `claude-fable-5` onto its `fable` row; an agent
     * that checked its own list would refuse, and refusing leaves the
     * conversation on the pin. So the row is named where a row can be found.
     *
     * WHAT IT COSTS, and this is the honest half: olai's note is not the only
     * way this conversation's model can move. A `/model` typed into a terminal
     * `claude --resume` on the SAME conversation between two olai boots lands
     * in the transcript, arrives here as a picker that disagrees with the note,
     * and is put back. Olai cannot tell that from the pin it exists to overrule
     * — the wire says which model, never who decided it — and between a panel
     * that loses the choice made IN it every single restart and one that can
     * lose a choice made elsewhere while it was not running, the second is the
     * better failure. Said in `docs/chat.md` rather than only here.
     *
     * A REFUSAL IS A ROW, not a boot failure: the conversation is open and
     * usable on the agent's own model, which is exactly what it was before this
     * existed. The memory is left ALONE on that path — untouched, so the next
     * boot tries again — and the header goes on naming what the agent said.

 * request waiting on it. Everything else it can reject with is silence:
 * `close()` rejects every pending request with the reason the connection died
 * of, and a write that fails leaves the request pending until one of those two
 * happens. So the whole of the reading is this `instanceof`, and the losing
 * direction is the safe one — an unrecognised rejection reads as `unanswered`,
 * which offers a person nothing rather than offering a retry that could
 * duplicate a message the agent already has.
 *
 * ONE ARM IS A BET, and it is JSON-RPC's rather than ours: that an error
 * RESPONSE means the request did not take effect. An agent that took a steer
 * and then answered it with an error would be read as a refusal and offered a
 * retry — a protocol violation, and the only shape in here that could produce a
 * duplicate.
 *
 * IT ANSWERS TWO OF THE THREE {@link Gone} VALUES and never the third, which is

 * there was nothing to reject at all, so a value read off a REJECTION cannot be
 * it. That is what makes `refused` mean exactly one thing here — the agent
 * spoke — and what a caller deciding whether there is still an agent reads.
 *
 * The SDK also mints a `RequestError` ITSELF for a response frame it cannot
 * parse (`invalidRequest`), which is the agent having said SOMETHING
 * unreadable rather than having said no. Read as a refusal, like the rest. It
 * was worth excluding by code and is deliberately not: `-32600` off the WIRE is
 * a genuine refusal ("your request was invalid"), so the guard would trade one
 * rare misreading for another and pay a magic number for it — while pinning

 * sound or an attached resource left a blank in the conversation where its
 * answer had been. A reader cannot tell that from an agent that said nothing,
 * and the two need entirely different things done about them.
 *
 * So a marker, in the shape the transcript already uses for its own asides
 * (`[image]`), naming what arrived and — where the protocol gives one — what it
 * was called. Rendering the picture itself is a bigger question that belongs
 * with the attachments the composer already sends; what is owed here is the
 * difference between "nothing" and "something this panel cannot draw".
 *
 * The `default` arm is not dead code: `ContentBlock` is somebody else's union
 * and it gains variants, so an unknown block is a marker rather than a hole.

 * What a running call has to say for itself, out of the protocol's content
 * blocks.
 *
 * A tool call is not instantaneous, and until this was read an unfolded one
 * showed its arguments and then nothing at all until it completed — a grep over
 * a large tree, a long shell command, a file being written line by line, all
 * indistinguishable from a call that had hung.
 *
 * The protocol's three block kinds are read for the one thing a transcript row
 * can show as a line: text. `content` is prose or an embedded resource, and
 * `terminal` is an id whose output arrives over a separate member this client
 * does not open.
 *
 * A `diff` is NOT read here any more, and that inversion is the whole of
 * `chat-edit-diffs`. It used to be flattened to the sentence `— <path>` on the
 * argument that a unified diff in a folded frame is a page of text where a line
 * was wanted, and that the outline itself is where an olai edit shows up
 * anyway. The second half is what stopped being true: a direct edit to a `.md`
 * or a source file shows up in NO outline, so naming the file was the whole of
 * what a person got and the answer to "what changed" was a terminal. It travels
 * structurally now (`@olai/acp`'s `diffsOf`) and the panel draws it, trimmed —
 * naming it here as well would be the same file reported twice, once as a
 * change and once as a sentence about one.
 *
 * REPLACES rather than appends, which is the protocol's own rule for an update:
 * a report carries the call's content as it stands now, so accumulating them
 * would print the first half of the output twice.

 *
