/**
 * An ACP agent that, on the SECOND `session/new`, first emits leftovers from
 * the conversation just closed — a forwarded `init` with servers `connected`,
 * and a `session/update` chunk of the last turn — and only then answers.
 *
 * ITS PRIVATE CHANNEL IS MADE UP, and deliberately: it used to be the Claude
 * Code adapter's own `_claude/sdkMessage`, which put one engine's spelling in a
 * core package after the engines became plugins. What this fixture is about is
 * a WINDOW in `agent.ts` — a message forwarded for a conversation that has
 * closed — and any wire that forwards messages has it. The leg the bench reads
 * it with is the matching fixture (`../agents/legs.testlib.ts`'s `FORWARDS`);
 * each real engine's own spelling is asserted in that engine's package.
 *
 * That is the load-shaped window the conversations-servers flake sits in:
 * olai has already announced the next roster as `handed` and emptied the
 * transcript, and `session` is still null waiting for this answer. Pre-fix,
 * both leftovers land. Post-fix, neither does.
 *
 * `session/load` of the first conversation still replays, so the un-close
 * that makes a return visit draw is pinned beside the drop.
