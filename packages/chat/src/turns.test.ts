/**
 * The turns in flight, over values.
 *
 * Every rule in {@link ./turns.ts} is one the panel depends on at a moment
 * nobody can arrange from outside: a second prompt going out while the first is
 * still running, a cancel pressed with two of them live, a shutdown that owns
 * both fibers. Reaching any of them through the real thing means starting a
 * subprocess, holding a turn open and typing into it — so they are asserted
 * here, the way {@link ./calls.ts}' and {@link ./questions.ts}' rules are, and
 * the e2e suite drives the same shape through a real panel
 * (`features/the_agent.feature`, the queued-message scenarios).
 *
 * WHAT EACH TEST IS ABOUT is the difference from a SLOT, because that is what
 * this replaced and what a future reader might think would do: a slot holds the
 * newest, and every case below is one where the newest is the wrong answer.
 * Since `compact-lost-to-steer` there is a second question with the same shape
 * — WHICH one the agent is working on — and the answer is the other end of the
 * same order: the oldest.
