/**
 * OPTIONAL MCP SERVERS: whether the tools this host might have are here, asked
 * once per conversation.
 *
 * A session is handed olai's own tool server and then whatever else this
 * machine turns out to be running. What "whatever else" IS, this package does
 * not know and must not: it takes a LIST of things that answer one question —
 * *is your tool here, and what am I owed if it is not* — and the composition
 * root fills the list ({@link ./chat.ts}'s `Options.probes`).
 *
 * ## The name that used to be here
 *
 * This was `kolu.ts`, 341 lines of one appliance's name inside a package whose
 * whole subject is one conversation with one ACP agent. The judgement half of
 * it — what an absent padi MEANS, and the five English sentences it means it in
 * — is `olai-plugin-kolu`'s now, where the rest of olai's judgement about kolu
 * lives, and what is left here is the shape of the question.
 *
 * The division is worth stating in the words it is enforced by: **core displays
 * a sentence and never composes one.** There is no template in this file that a
 * plugin fills a noun into, because the ways a terminal daemon fails and the
 * ways a CI coordinator does have nothing in common but that they failed, and a
 * sentence built out of that shared nothing is the debug log line on a screen —
 * which is precisely what the incident behind `mcp-fail-visible` was debugged
 * around. {@link Probed} carries whole sentences and this module carries them
 * through.
 *
 * ## Three shapes, spelled here rather than imported
 *
 * `@olai/plugin-api` declares these too, and so does each plugin, and that is the
 * arrangement rather than a duplication waiting to be tidied. This package sits
 * a floor BELOW the plugin system — it is `@olai/server` that meets an
 * appliance, through one door, and `@olai/chat` that is handed a list — so an
 * import from here would invert the direction the whole plugin wall is built
 * out of. What proves the two spellings agree is the composition root, where a
 * plugin's probe and this list meet in one expression; a shape that drifted is
 * a type error on that line.

 * A probe starts a subprocess and waits for it to answer, with a deadline
 * measured in seconds — kolu's is five. This runs on the SESSION-OPEN path, and
 * that path already has a documented race: the panel is emptied and `session`
 * is `null` until the open completes, so anything slow in here is a window in
 * which a leftover notification from the conversation just left lands on the
 * next one ({@link ./agent.ts}'s `closed` set). Asking N plugins one after
 * another would multiply that window by N, which is the same bug with a bigger
 * number on it.
 *
 * So they overlap, and the wall clock is the SLOWEST probe rather than the sum.
 * Bounded rather than unbounded because each one is a process start: a build
 * with a dozen plugins would otherwise fork a dozen executables at the instant
 * somebody pressed a conversation open, on a machine that may be running none
 * of them. Four is the width at which the two plugins this binary has today —
 * and the next few — cost exactly one probe's latency.
