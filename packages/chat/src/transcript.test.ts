/**
 * ... and what a death is CALLED, against the adapter this panel ships with
 * rather than against the convenient fiction the fixtures above share.
 *
 * The block above titles its spawns with what they were sent to do, which is
 * what the e2e fake agent does too — and it is not what the real adapter does.
 * An `Agent` call is titled with the TOOL's name, and a row's title is pinned
 * at the first frame that carries one, so every agent of a fan-out is a row
 * reading `Task`. Every test up to here passes either way, which is exactly how
 * the death lines came to say *the agent “Task” ended* while three other
 * surfaces had already been taught better (both reviewers of #412, converging).
 *
 * So these drive the SHAPE THE ADAPTER SENDS: a title that is the tool's name,
 * and the description beside it in `spawned.said`.
