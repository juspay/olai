/**
 * How a directory is SPELLED, decided once.
 *
 * A served directory arrives from more than one hand and none of them agree
 * about a trailing slash: a person's argument, an agent that stores whichever
 * spelling it was handed back in its session list, and this process's own
 * `cwd`. Two places in this package care, and they have to care the same way —
 * {@link ./agent.ts} matches a stored session's directory against ours, and
 * {@link ./memory.ts} names a file after ours and checks what is in it. A rule
 * decided twice is one that can grow a `resolve()` on one side only, and what
 * that costs here is silent: the remembered conversation is filed under a key
 * nothing looks for, and the panel opens somebody else's — which is the bug
 * this package just finished fixing.
