/**
 * LEGS TO TEST AGAINST — the two shapes an agent's wire comes in, spelled here
 * rather than borrowed from an engine.
 *
 * ## Why they are fixtures now
 *
 * The benches in this package used to reach for `CLAUDE` and `OPENCODE` — the
 * real legs, three files away in `./agents/`. They are not three files away any
 * more: each engine is a PLUGIN, and `packages/bundle/src/fence.test.ts` holds
 * as an equality per package that a general package neither imports one nor
 * spells one. `@olai/chat` is the general package that seats them.
 *
 * That is a better arrangement for these tests rather than a cost, and the
 * reason is what each of them is actually about. `Calls` is about REMEMBERING
 * what a frame said, not about the Claude Code adapter's `_meta` corner; the
 * chat's lifecycle cases are about a queued message and a withdrawn gesture, not
 * about opencode. Every one of them wants A LEG OF A CERTAIN SHAPE, and reading
 * the shape off a real engine made the case quietly depend on facts that engine
 * is free to change on its own release clock — which is the whole reason those
 * facts moved into that engine's directory.
 *
 * Each engine's OWN readings are asserted in its own package
 * (`packages/plugins/<engine>/src/leg.test.ts`), against payloads captured off
 * that engine's real wire. That is where a bet about an adapter belongs, and it
 * is where a bump of that adapter's pin goes red.
 */

/**
 * AN AGENT THAT SAYS NOTHING — every reader `null`, every capability absent.
 *
 * The floor the other two are built on, and a shape a real engine genuinely has:
 * a leg that recognises nothing matches nothing, and what happens then is that a
 * person is asked. **Nothing is ever approved by failing to recognise it**, so
 * the emptiest leg is also the safest one, which is why it is the base rather
 * than a special case.

 * servers and answers with a session id; whether the agent reached any of them
 * is never on the wire, so an agent that volunteers it does so on a channel of

 *
 * The channel and the payload here are MADE UP, matching `../fixtures/
