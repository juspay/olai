/**
 * The model picker's MACHINERY, over values — finding the entry, reading what
 * it offers, and crossing the two vocabularies in both directions.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE is any one adapter's arithmetic. Which entry is the model and
 * what its rows are called are the LEG's ({@link ../../../acp/src/leg.ts}'s
 * `ModelReading`), so the cases below hand in a reading of their own: a picker
 * whose values are aliases and a two-line resolver for them. That is enough to
 * state what this module does — a value the picker offers is its own word, a
 * live id is asked for as the row that names it, two rows that could both be it
 * answer for neither — without borrowing the Claude Code CLI's table, which is
 * `olai-plugin-claude`'s and is asserted there.
 *
 * What this file adds over a scenario is the near misses, cheap as values and
 * expensive to stage: a model nobody offers, two rows sharing a name, an entry
 * that is not a select.
