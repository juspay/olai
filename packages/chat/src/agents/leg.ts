/**
 * WHAT AN AGENT MEANS by what it sends — as one interface, with one
 * implementation per agent olai knows how to talk to.
 *
 * The protocol proper is read where it is spoken ({@link ../agent.ts} and
 * `@olai/acp`). What is read HERE is everything that is only true of ONE agent:
 * a `_meta` extension one adapter writes, a tool-naming convention one CLI
 * uses, a permission mode one of them has and the other refuses, a steering
 * method that exists on one wire and not the other. Before there were two
 * agents this was a file called `interpret.ts` and the bets were simply the
 * Claude Code adapter's; the file is still here ({@link ./claude.ts}, meaning
 * unchanged) and it now answers to a shape instead of being the shape.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT SURVIVES THE SPLIT, and the one a reviewer should check every
 * new leg against: **every bet is safe to lose in one direction only, and that
 * is the direction it loses in.** An agent that says none of this matches
 * nothing, and what happens then is that a person is asked. **Nothing is ever
 * approved by failing to recognise it.** A leg that answered a tool name it had
 * not positively recognised, or an allow-option for a tool it could not name,
 * would be approving somebody's permissions on their behalf — which is the one
 * failure in this package that is not recoverable by pressing something.
 *
 * EVERY MEMBER IS A PURE FUNCTION OR A CONSTANT, for the reason the old file
 * gave: the rule that stops this panel approving its own permissions is a
 * function with unit tests rather than a branch reachable only by starting a
 * subprocess and talking it into asking.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE is anything the PROTOCOL carries for everybody — a content
 * block, a usage report, a diff — which is `@olai/acp`'s, and anything a leg
 * would have to KNOW ABOUT A CONVERSATION to answer, which is the caller's.
 * Which side of the boundary a new reader belongs on is not which payload it
 * reads but WHO has to have sent it.
