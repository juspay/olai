/**
 * The protocol's diff blocks, read as data.
 *
 * A tool call's content is a list of blocks and this file is about exactly one
 * kind of them: `diff`, which is a file being rewritten — a path, what was
 * there, and what is there now. Every other kind is somebody else's (the chat
 * package's `progressOf`, which reads them for the one thing a line of a
 * transcript can show).
 *
 * It used to be read the same way as the rest and that is what this file
 * replaces: a diff block was flattened into the sentence `— <path>` in the
 * progress string, deliberately — "a unified diff in a folded frame is a page
 * of text where a line was wanted, and the outline itself is where an olai edit
 * shows up anyway". The second half of that is what stopped being true. A
 * direct edit to a `.md` or to a source file does NOT show up in the outline,
 * so the transcript naming it was the whole of what a person got, and the
 * answer to "what did it change" was a terminal.
 *
 * So the wire carries the diff STRUCTURED ({@link FileDiff}) and the panel
 * draws it. Nothing here computes a line diff: the two texts are what the
 * protocol sends and what a browser derives its rendering from, which keeps
 * this side free of a second diff implementation and keeps the client's one
 * where every other view-time derivation lives.
 *
 * PURE, and tested as such — the {@link ./asks.ts} pattern, for the same
 * reason: a reading of somebody else's payload is a function over a value, not
 * a branch reachable only by talking a subprocess into sending one.
