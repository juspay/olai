/**
 * The diff blocks, over values.
 *
 * The payloads are the protocol's own (`ToolCallContent`), as the Claude Code
 * adapter sends them for an `Edit` or a `Write`: an absolute path, the text
 * that was there — absent for a file being created — and the text that is there
 * now. What is worth testing without a subprocess is the reading itself, which
 * is the one place a file being rewritten can be lost: the wire carries what
 * this returns, and a diff dropped here is a change the panel never hears about.
