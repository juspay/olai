/**
 * @olai/kolu-client — HOW OLAI REACHES KOLU, and the only place that knows how.
 *
 * One package holds the dial, the standing mirror, the projection into olai's
 * own vocabulary, and the one screen read. What leaves is `@olai/surface`'s
 * shapes — a `KoluLink`, a `FleetTerminal`, a `Snapshot` — so a
 * change to padi's contract is a change HERE and stops.
 *
 * ## Why a PACKAGE and not a directory under the server
 *
 * It began as `packages/server/src/kolu/`, and the argument against that is
 * about direction rather than tidiness. A directory can import its parent: one
 * convenient reach into `@olai/server`'s `runtime.ts` for a type, and the
 * boundary is a comment somebody has to keep believing. A PACKAGE WALL MAKES
 * THE DIRECTION PHYSICS — `@olai/kolu-client` cannot depend on `@olai/server`,
 * because a cycle does not resolve. Nothing has to be remembered and nothing
 * has to be swept for.
 *
 * That is also why the boundary check this repo briefly grew — a grep for padi
 * imports outside one directory — was deleted rather than kept: it was a
 * substitute for a wall, and the wall is here. The manifest is `@olai/surface`
 * and `effect`, and that is the whole olai half of it: the vocabulary
 * everything here produces, and nothing that can reach back.
 *
 * `@olai/format` is deliberately NOT in it. The walk over the vault that
 * decides who OWNS a terminal reads outline records, so it belongs to whoever
 * holds the vault (`@olai/server`'s `claimants.ts`); what crosses into this
 * package is four strings per claim ({@link ./fleet.ts}'s `Claimant`). Keeping
 * that edge out is what stops "how olai reaches kolu" from also knowing what an
 * outline node is — two subjects in one package, and a dependency with nothing
 * to do with padi.
 *
 * ## What is here, and what deliberately is not
 *
 * Phase 1a's half: the dial and its standing mirror ({@link ./link.ts}), the
 * projection and the ownership overlay ({@link ./fleet.ts}), the dot's fold
 * the rendezvous ({@link ./socket.ts}) and the snapshot
 * read ({@link ./screen.ts}). {@link ./index.ts}'s `koluHalf` is what a server
 * composes: three surface members and one revision hook.
 *
 * The driver, the gate predicates and the procedure registry
 * `docs/brainstorming/orchestrator.md` also names are LATER PHASES and are
 * deliberately absent — a registry with one entry is a shape arguing for itself
 * before anything needs it. When they land they land here, which is the other
 * half of what the wall buys: there is somewhere for them to go that is not the
 * composition root.
 *
 * ## `null` is a setting, and it is most of the faces
 *
 * `olai web` dials. Every other face — `/mcp`, `olai surface`, a test — passes
 * `null`, and {@link koluHalf} answers each member the way an unreachable padi
 * does: the cell stays `absent`, the fleet is empty, the snapshot refuses in
 * words. ONE code path rather than two, which is the point — "this process has
 * no business holding a socket open" and "this laptop is not running kolu" are
 * the same thing to a reader, so they should be the same thing to the code.
 *
 * ## The five homes — the map, so a grep for `kolu` is not a reconstruction
 *
 * Five files in this repo carry kolu in their name or their imports, and they
 * are four independent concerns plus one twin. The list is kept in all five
 * headers on purpose (the fifth Löwy sitting, finding 4:
 * `docs/lowy-electricity/debate-2026-08-26.md`) — a reader who greps `kolu`
 * lands on whichever of them came first, and the map should be under that
 * reader's cursor rather than assembled out of the five files themselves.
 *
 *   - **`@olai/surface`'s `kolu.ts`** — THE WIRE SHAPES. What a browser is
 *     told about the link and the fleet, in olai's own vocabulary.
 *   - **`@olai/kolu-client`** — THE DIAL, and this package. The only one that
 *     speaks padi's wire: one socket per server, the standing mirror, the
 *     projection into those shapes.
 *   - **`@olai/server`'s join** — `runtime.ts`'s kolu half binds the three
 *     surface members to that dial; `claimants.ts` walks the vault for who
 *     OWNS a terminal.
 *   - **The web props** — `web/src/client/props/` reads both members as one
 *     subscription per tab and draws kolu's own Dock ROW (it was a chip; the
 *     dock-row fold retired olai's home-made vocabulary wholesale);
 *     `web/src/client/padi/` is the
 *     header's link indicator, a second reader of the same cell.
 *   - **`@olai/chat`'s `kolu.ts`** — A TWIN, not a floor of that stack. A
 *     one-shot spawn-time probe (`@kolu/detect`, over MCP stdio) that tells
 *     the chat panel's agent this host runs a kolu. Shares no code with the
 *     four above, deliberately.
 *
 * The wall this package is (above) is what keeps that a list of four homes
 * and not one blur: only this one dials, so the other three read
 * `@olai/surface`'s shapes and cannot reach padi even by accident.
