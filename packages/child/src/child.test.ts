/**
 * The socket, against real children.
 *
 * Two claims used to be false in the copies this package replaces, and they
 * are the ones a mock cannot hold: an exec that fails arrives as an event
 * after spawn has returned (an unhandled one is an uncaught exception), and
 * a close listener attached after the kill misses a child that is already
 * gone. Both are asserted here, against processes this host actually starts.
