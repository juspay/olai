/**
 * A subprocess, as one socket.
 *
 * Node's `spawn` returns before the exec has happened, so a `try` around the
 * call never sees the failure that actually happens — a bad interpreter line,
 * a path that stopped existing between being configured and being started, an
 * architecture this host cannot run. That failure arrives as an `error` EVENT,
 * and two things hang on somebody listening for it: an unhandled one is an
 * uncaught exception, and every other door then reports `Cannot call write
 * after a stream was destroyed` in place of the name of the file that would
 * not run. This file attaches that listener on the line after spawn, so a
 * caller races {@link Child.unstartable} against its own conversation and the
 * reason a person reads is the one about their machine.
 *
 * The rest of the socket is the same axis: drain the pipes so a child nobody
 * is reading cannot block; attach the close listener at spawn so a caller that
 * asks after the child is gone is not waiting for an event that will never
 * come again; kill with a grace period so SIGTERM has a chance and SIGKILL is
 * the escalation, not the opening. A clock is a hang detector that throws
 * {@link Hung} with what the child said — never the wait itself.
 *
 * What is not here, by design: whether the child is READY (the serving line,
 * the ACP handshake), how its pipes become a protocol, whether a dead one
 * should restart, and sweeping orphans. Those are each a different axis, and
 * each has an owner (#355 answered the last of them: the harness reaper and
 * PDEATHSIG).
