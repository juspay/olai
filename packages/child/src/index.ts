 * Spawn, the exec-failure that arrives after spawn returns, drained stderr,
 * and a kill with a grace period. Listeners attach at spawn. A wait is the
 * EVENT (the chunk, the exit, ESRCH); a clock is only a hang detector that
 * throws with what the child said.
 *
 * Explicitly out: readiness, transport, restart policy, the orphan sweep.
 * A caller whose needs exceed the socket keeps that residue on top of it.
