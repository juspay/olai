/**
 * One directory, read and served.
 *
 * This is the composition root, and it should read as one: a store over the
 * directory, the ops layer over the store, an internal MCP server over the ops,
 * an agent handed that server, the surface bound to both, a listener in front.
 * Each of those lives in its own file with its own reason to change; what is
 * left here is the ORDER they go in, and the one thing that is genuinely this
 * layer's business — the warning you get for binding somewhere the world can
 * reach.
 *
 * The order is not arbitrary. The chat is built before the surface because the
 * surface's transcript collection is seeded from it; the surface is what the
 * chat publishes through, so its publishers are handed back and installed once
 * it exists. Nothing publishes in between: the agent is not started until the
 * listener is up.
 *
 * It says what it is doing through Effect's own logging rather than a `log`
 * callback a caller passes in — see `@olai/log`. Two settings are established
 * here and inherited by everything below, including fibers the store and the
 * agent fork for themselves: the `root` annotation (`./directory.ts`, which
 * owns the reason it has to be set before the store is opened) and the `serve`
 * log span, so every line says how far into this serve it was emitted.
