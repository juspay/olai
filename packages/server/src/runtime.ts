/**
 * The surface, bound to the store and to the conversation.
 *
 * Two subjects, and the bindings say which is which:
 *
 *   - the DIRECTORY is the store's. One fiber follows `SubscriptionRef.changes`
 *     of the snapshot — current value first, then every later one — and each
 *     revision it sees becomes the writes of that revision: for each of the two
 *     collections the entries whose file moved and the keys whose file is gone,
 *     then the manifest. It is an OWNED source (the `manifest` cell's
 *     `connect`), like the error cell's, so it lives on the runtime's own scope
 *     and a failure in it settles `done`.
 *
 *     What makes that ONE fiber rather than three is that the collections and
 *     the cell are halves of one revision: publishing them from separate
 *     subscriptions to the same ref would let a reader see a manifest naming a
 *     revision whose entries had not been written yet, from a server that knew
 *     both.
 *   - the CONVERSATION is the chat's: a cell for where it stands, a collection
 *     for the rows, and the procedures. The collection is deliberately
 *     server-authored — `readAll` is the transcript itself and the writes come
 *     from `ctx`, never from the wire — because a transcript is something that
 *     HAPPENED and the only way to add to it is to prompt.
 *   - the KEYBOARD is the ops layer's: five procedures, no member of its own,
 *     and nothing published from here when one lands. That absence IS the
 *     design — an edit changes a FILE, and a file reaches every open tab
 *     through the store binding above, the same way a `git pull` does. A
 *     procedure that also echoed its result would be a second answer to what
 *     the directory says, arriving first and occasionally disagreeing.
 *
 * Nothing here interprets an outline or an agent. It moves what the store and
 * the chat decided onto the wire, and that is all — with one exception, and it
 * is one indirection deep: an edit's INTENT is resolved into an op by
 * `./edit.ts`, because that is a question about the snapshot rather than about
 * the wire.
