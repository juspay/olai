/**
 * THE AGENT HALF OF THE SIGN-IN BENCH — an ACP agent with two `terminal` auth
 * methods and nothing else.
 *
 * It exists for one question a browser scenario cannot ask: what happens when
 * TWO PRESSES arrive in the same instant. A scenario presses one button and then
 * another, which is the attach case; the race is two callers inside one tick,
 * and that is a unit test's to arrange (`../agent.test.ts`).
 *
 * The command line it hands over is the test's, through the environment rather
 * than through a literal here: `OLAI_TEST_LOGIN_BUN` / `OLAI_TEST_LOGIN_SCRIPT` /
 * `OLAI_TEST_LOGIN_LOG` are what the bench sets, and the adapter reads them the
 * way the pinned Claude adapter reads its own argv — `process.execPath` plus a
 * script, which is exactly the shape `_meta["terminal-auth"]` carries.
 *
 * `other-login` is the second method, and it is there to be offered and NOT
 * pressed: a press of a different method while one is running must be refused
 * rather than attach (`Agent.signIn`).
 */

 *  settles it, and every fixture in this directory says so one way or another —
