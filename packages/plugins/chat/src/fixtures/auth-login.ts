/**
 * THE COMMAND a `terminal` auth method hands over, in the bench's own shape: it
 * RECORDS that it was spawned (which is what a test counts — one process per
 * attempt, never two), says a URL, and exits 0.
 *
 * The pause before the exit is the whole of the timing: a sign-in that ended
 * the instant it started would let a second press in the same tick find an
 * empty slot by luck rather than by the claim, and this bench is about the
 * claim (`../agent.test.ts`).
