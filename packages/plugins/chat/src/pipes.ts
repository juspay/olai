/**
 * A subprocess's pipes, as a stream of JSON-RPC messages.
 *
 * This package starts two kinds of subprocess and both speak line-delimited
 * JSON-RPC on stdio — the ACP agent ({@link ./agent.ts}) and, for the length of
 * one question, an optional MCP server this host might be running
 * ({@link ./probes.ts}). What they say to each
 * other is nothing alike; how a message gets on and off a pipe is identical, so
 * it is written once, here, and neither of them owns it.
 *
 * What this file owns is TRANSPORT, and only that: how a child's stdin/stdout
 * become Web streams. Whether the child ever ran is `@olai/child`'s
 * (`unstartable`, attached at spawn). Built by hand rather than with
 * `stream.Web` helpers because this runs under Bun's Node compatibility, and
 * the two adapters differ in when they close and how they surface a broken
 * pipe — twenty lines with the lifecycle written out beats a helper whose
 * behaviour we would be assuming. That is a reason to change this file and no
 * reason to change either caller.
