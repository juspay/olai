/**
 * One spelling of a directory, and the two questions that turn on it.
 *
 * Small, and worth writing down anyway: the rule is read by the thing that
 * matches a stored session's directory against ours and by the thing that names
 * this directory's memory after it, and the two must never come to answer
 * differently — which is the failure this package's whole `chat-restore-wrong`
 * fix is about, arrived at from underneath.
