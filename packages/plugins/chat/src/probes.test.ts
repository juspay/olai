/**
 * The generic seam: what a session is handed, and what it is told about what it
 * was not.
 *
 * PURE of any appliance, which is the claim this file exists to hold as much as
 * any assertion in it. Its fixtures are servers called `alpha` and `beta`,
 * because nothing in `olai-plugin-chat` may know what an optional MCP server actually
 * IS — the probes arrive as a list ({@link ./probes.ts}) and this package's job
 * is to ask them all once, hand over what answered, and carry whole the
 * sentence about what did not.
 *
 * The rendering case came from `kolu.test.ts`, which asserted `mcpServersOf`
 * from a file that was otherwise entirely about detecting one appliance. The
 * probe moved to `olai-plugin-kolu`; the rendering belongs to whoever owns
 * `mcpServersOf`, which is this package.
