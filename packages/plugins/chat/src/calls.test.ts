/**
 * What is known about a call, over values.
 *
 * Every rule here is one the panel depends on at a moment nobody can arrange:
 * a permission request arriving after the frame that named its tool, a
 * subagent's question arriving after the frame that said whose it was, a
 * completion arriving after both. Reaching any of them through the real thing
 * means starting a subprocess and talking it into a fan-out — so they are
 * asserted here, the way {@link ./questions.ts}'s state machine is — and, one
 * wall out, the way each engine's own readings are in its own package.
 *
 * THE LEGS BELOW ARE FIXTURES ({@link ./agents/legs.testlib.ts}) rather than
 * real engines, and that is the phase: what this file is about is what `Calls`
 * REMEMBERS, and the two shapes it has to remember it out of are "the frame said
 * it" and "the id said it". Reading those off a real adapter made every case
 * here quietly depend on facts that adapter is free to change on its own release
 * clock — which is exactly why those facts now live in that engine's directory.
