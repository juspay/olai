/**
 * WHAT THIS ADAPTER CALLS ITS OWN MODELS ({@link ./models.ts}), over values.
 *
 * ONE ENGINE'S ARITHMETIC, which is why it is in this package rather than in
 * the one that reads a picker. The Claude Code adapter is where the awkward
 * cases live, because it is the one whose picker offers ALIASES for the ids its
 * CLI reports; an agent whose picker offers the ids themselves matches at the
 * first tier and takes `namedExactly` instead, which is the boring case the
 * general rule also has to get right (`olai-plugin-chat`'s `agents/models.test.ts`).
 *
 * What this file adds over a scenario is the near misses, cheap as values and
 * expensive to stage: a family alias against a lane-pinned row, two rows that
 * could both answer, a dated id no alias covers.
