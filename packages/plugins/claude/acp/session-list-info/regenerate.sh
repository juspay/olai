# Rebuild acp/patches/session-list-info.patch.
#
# The patch is a diff against the pin's compiled `dist/acp-agent.js`, made the
# only way one can be trusted: by EDITING A COPY by its anchors and letting
# `diff -u` count the hunks. Hand-computed hunk headers were precisely the
# recipe three rounds of "corrupt patch" runs sin-ed here; fmt by machine.
#
# Sources:
#   - the helper block spliced before the class = facts.js (the piece that is
#     TESTED, `bun test acp/session-list-info`) shipped with `export` off,
#     under a banner that names this regen command;
#   - the NEW listSessions body is the heredoc below, authored by hand for
#     the bundle's names (sanitizeTitle, this.logger, the SDK's readers).
# Anchoring is by the SURROUNDING text, not line numbers, so a pin bump that
# moves the content fails HERE with a visible name — and at the build, which
# is the point of `patch -p1 -F0`.
#
# The bundle the diff is taken from has to be the pin's PRISTINE extract —
# any build found in the store already carries olai's patches, and a patch
# against them is the four-hunk failure this script's first version taught.
# The pin version comes out of the lockfile, the one input the derivation
# itself reads, so version and bundle move together
# (`mechanism, never convention`).

# WHERE THIS RIG SITS, since the agents phase moved it: this directory is
# `packages/plugins/claude/acp/session-list-info/`, so the plugin's own `acp/`
# is one up and the REPOSITORY is four. The npm shim whose lockfile pins the
# version is still the shared one at the repository root (`acp/README.md` says
# why one lockfile carries two adapters).
